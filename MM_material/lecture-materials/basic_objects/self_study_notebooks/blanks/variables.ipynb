Mutable objects are those that can be changed during runtime, examples include objects of type list, dictionary and set. For mutable objects there are operations, referred to as mutations, that can change the object after it has been instantiated. Lists are perhaps the simplest mutable object, so lets assign a variable x to the list of numbers [1,2,3] and then assign another variable y to x."
