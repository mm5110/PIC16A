    "An Ulam spiral is a graphical depiction of the set of prime numbers with intriguing geometrical patterns. This depiction was created by the famous mathematician Stanis≈Çaw Ulam. Ulam is better known for several of his other creations, including the design of the hydrogen bomb and the invention of Monte Carlo methods for simulating stochastic (random) processes. \n",

    "## What We'll Do\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, we wrote a variety of functions that can be used for checking prime numbers. So, to make an Ulam spiral, it remains only to find a way to iterate over a grid in the \"spiral\" shape you see above. For this, we'll use a *generator*, one of our fancy new iteration tools. We'll be able to use our generator, called `spiral`, like the below. In this example, we suppose that the grid is of size `5x5`. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i, j, k in spiral(5):\n",
    "    print(i,j,k)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2 2 1\n",
    "    3 2 2\n",
    "    3 1 3\n",
    "    2 1 4\n",
    "    1 1 5\n",
    "    #...\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first two numbers give the **coordinates** of a square, while the third number gives the integer corresponding to that square. For example, the number `1` corresponds to `(2,2)`, the number `4` corresponds to `(2,1)`, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "We start at `(2,2)` because this is the middle of a `5x5` grid. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take a moment to compare to the first diagram to convince yourself that this generator is doing what you would expect. "

    "1. We take **one** step right, then turn left (so now we are facing up). We take **one** step up, then turn left again (so now we are facing left). \n",

    "3. Then, we take **three** steps...\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a diagram illustrating our approach. The first pair of grey lines are both one unit in length; the next pair of red lines are both two units in length; the third pair of orange lines are three units in length; and so on. \n",

    "\n",
    "So, our approach is to implement this behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `spiral()` should accept a single argument `n`, an odd integer. Check that `n` is an integer, and raise a `TypeError` if not. Then, check that `n` is *odd*, and raise a `ValueError` if not. \n",
    "1. Start with a variable  `pos = (m,m)`, where `m = int((n-1)/2)` is the midpoint of the grid. Additionally, initialize a variable `k = 1` to log the current integer, and a `direction` tuple with `(0,1)` indicating the direction we are facing. Finally, initialize a `length` variable with value `1`. \n",
    "2. **Main loop:**\n",
    "    1. As long as `k <= n**2 - 1`\n",
    "        1. Do the following twice (that is, do i and ii, then do i and ii again). *Don't write the same code twice!* \n",
    "            1. Take a number of steps equal to `length`. In a step, we add the current `direction` to the current position `pos` entrywise. \n",
    "            In order to update the tuple `pos`, you will need to do something like this: \n",
    "            `pos = pos[0] + direction[0], pos[1] + direction[1]`. \n",
    "            **Before each step**, if `k <= n**2 - 1`, yield `(pos[0], pos[1], k)`, then increment `k` by one. \n",
    "            2. Change direction by making a left turn. You can do so by replacing `direction` with its value in the supplied `left_turns` dictionary. \n",
    "        2. Increment length by 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the \"main part\" of the activity, so it's ok to spend some extra time here. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Hint***: *The following dictionary might help you make left turns.*\n",
