    "# Discussion 4: Closures\n",
    "\n",
    "In the recorded lectures, we've mentioned the idea of \"functions with memory\" a few times, mostly in the context of bad examples. There is a good to write functions with memory -- using **closures.** A closure is just a function that returns another function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason that closures can be advantageous is that the returned (\"inner\") function has access to the variables created in the \"outer\" function. This is especially useful when these variables are mutable. Here's a simple example. "
